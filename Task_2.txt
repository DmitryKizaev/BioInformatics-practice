2.2 Peptide Encoding Problem

1 ?? 1 ????a  ???????

We say that a DNA string Pattern encodes an amino acid string Peptide
if the RNA string transcribed from either Pattern or its reverse complement
Pattern translates into Peptide. For example, the DNA string GAAACT is transcribed
into GAAACU and translated into ET. The reverse complement of this DNA string, AGTTTC,
is transcribed into AGUUUC and translated into SF. Thus, GAAACT encodes both ET and SF.

CODE CHALLENGE: Peptide Encoding Problem.

Peptide Encoding Problem: Find substrings of a genome encoding a given amino acid sequence.
     Input: A DNA string Text, an amino acid string Peptide, and the array GeneticCode.
     Output: All substrings of Text encoding Peptide (if any such substrings exist).

Note: The solution may contain repeated strings if the same string occurs more than once as a substring of Text and encodes Peptide.
