CODE CHALLENGE: Generating Theoretical Spectrum Problem.

Generating Theoretical Spectrum Problem: Generate the theoretical spectrum of a cyclic peptide.
     Input: An amino acid string Peptide.
     Output: Cyclospectrum(Peptide).

Note: An obvious approach for solving the Generating Theoretical Spectrum Problem
would be to construct a list containing all subpeptides of Peptide, and then find
the mass of each subpeptide by adding the integer masses of its constituent amino acids.

Sample Input:
LEQN

Sample Output:
0 113 114 128 129 227 242 242 257 355 356 370 371 484
